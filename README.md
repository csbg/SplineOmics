The R package `SplineOmics` finds the significant features (hits) of
time-series omics data by using splines and `limma` for hypothesis
testing and clusters the hits based on the spline shape while plotting
showing all results in summary HTML reports.

## üìò Introduction

Welcome to `SplineOmics`, an R package designed to streamline the
analysis of -omics time-series data, followed by automated HTML report
generation.

### Is the SplineOmics package of use for me?

If you have -omics data over time, the package will help you to run
`limma` with splines, decide on which parameters to use, perform the
clustering, run GSEA and show result plots in HTML reports.

### What do I need precisely?

1.  A data matrix where each row is a feature (e.g., protein,
    metabolite, etc.) and each column is a sample taken at a specific
    time.

2.  A table with identifiers on the rows/features of the data matrix
    (e.g., gene and protein name)

3.  A table with metadata on the columns/samples of the data matrix
    (e.g., batch, time point, etc.)

### Capabilities

With `SplineOmics`, you can:

- **Automatically perform exploratory data analysis:**

  The `explore_data()` function generates an HTML report, containing
  various plots, such as density, PCA, and correlation heatmap plots.

- **Explore various limma splines hyperparameters:**

  Test combinations of hyperparameters, such as different datasets,
  `limma` design formulas, degrees of freedom, p-value thresholds, etc.,
  using the `screen_limma_hyperparams()` function.

- **Perform limma spline analysis:**

  Use the `run_limma_splines()` function to perform the `limma` analysis
  with splines once the optimal hyperparameters are identified.

- **Cluster significant features:**

  Cluster the significant features (hits) identified in the spline
  analysis with the `cluster_hits()` function.

- **Run GSEA with clustered hits:**

  Perform gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the clustered hits
  with the `create_gsea_report()` function.

- **Generate reports:**

  Automatically generate reports to showcase all results.

## üîß Installation

Follow these steps to install the `SplineOmics` package from the GitHub
repository into your R environment.

#### Prerequisites

- Ensure **R** is installed on your system. If not, download and install
  it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
- **RStudio** is recommended for a more user-friendly experience with R.
  Download and install RStudio from
  [posit.co](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

#### Installation Steps

1.  **Open RStudio** or your R console.

2.  **Install and load `remotes`, and install `SplineOmics` from
    GitHub**:

    Copy and paste the following code block into your R console.

    ``` r
    # Check if BiocManager is installed; if not, install it
    if (!requireNamespace(
      "BiocManager",
      quietly = TRUE
      )) {
      install.packages("BiocManager")
    }

    # Install necessary Bioconductor dependencies
    BiocManager::install(c(
      "ComplexHeatmap",
      "clusterProfiler",
      "limma"
      ))

    # Check if remotes is installed; if not, install it
    if (!requireNamespace(
      "remotes",
      quietly = TRUE
      )) {
      install.packages("remotes")
    }

    # Load remotes package
    library(remotes)

    # This line will be deleted once the repo is public
    Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "your_GitHub_PAT")

    # Install latest SplineOmics version from GitHub
    remotes::install_github(
      "csbg/SplineOmics@main",
      force = TRUE
      )
    ```

3.  **Load the `SplineOmics` package**:

    Once the installation is complete, load the `SplineOmics` package
    into your R session or script to start using it:

    ``` r
    library(SplineOmics)
    ```

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors related to dependencies or package versions
during installation, try updating your R and RStudio to the latest
versions and repeat the installation steps.

For issues specifically related to the `SplineOmics` package, check the
[Issues section](https://github.com/%3Cuser%3E/%3Crepo%3E/issues) of the
GitHub repository for similar problems or to post a new issue.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Tutorial

[This
tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csbg/SplineOmics/main/doc/get-started.html)
covers a real CHO cell time-series proteomics example from start to the
end.

When you have the `SplineOmics` package installed, you can also run the
following commands in `RStudio` to start the tutorial as an interactive
demo:

``` r
library(SplineOmics)
i_demo()
```

This opens the R Markdown file of the demo in `RStudio`.
