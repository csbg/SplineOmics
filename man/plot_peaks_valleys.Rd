\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric matrix, where rows correspond to features (e.g., genes, 
proteins, metabolites) and columns correspond to samples.}

\item{meta}{A data frame containing metadata for the samples. Must include
a column named `"Time"` that specifies the timepoint for each sample.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value specifying the significance threshold 
for displaying stars above excursion points. Defaults to `0.05`.}

\item{results}{A list returned from `detect_excursions()`, containing 
`results_df` (excursion matrix) and `pairwise_pvals` (one-tailed p-values for 
the excursion contrast).}

\item{meta_replicates_column}{A character string specifying the column name 
in `meta` that indicates biological replicates.}
}
\value{
A named list of ggplot objects, where each element corresponds to a 
feature with detected excursions. Each plot displays the expression levels 
across timepoints, with replicates distinguished by different shapes.

A named list of ggplot objects, where each element corresponds to a 
feature with at least one detected excursion. Each plot displays the 
expression levels across timepoints, with replicates distinguished by shape.

\description{
This function generates scatter plots for features that exhibit excursions
in time-series omics data. Excursion points are highlighted in red, while 
normal points remain grey. Significance stars are added to indicate the 
statistical significance of adjacent pairwise comparisons.

This function generates scatter plots for features that exhibit significant 
local peaks or valleys (excursions) in time-series omics data. Excursion 
points are highlighted in red, while normal points remain grey. If the 
excursion is statistically significant (based on the compound contrast test), 
a significance star is shown directly above the excursion point.
}
\details{
- The function first extracts features with at least one excursion.
- Each feature's expression is plotted across time using `ggplot2`.
- Replicates are displayed with distinct shapes, while excursion points 
  are highlighted in red.
- Significance stars (`*`, `**`, `***`, `****`) are placed between 
  adjacent timepoints if their pairwise comparison is significant.
- The significance stars are positioned above horizontal lines, with 
  right-side comparisons always placed slightly higher for clarity.
