\title{Correlate adjusted p-values between two SplineOmics results}
\usage{
correlate_results(splineomics1, splineomics2)
}
\arguments{
\item{splineomics1}{A SplineOmics result object (typically a list) containing
a `"limma_splines_result"` entry with topTables organized by category and 
subcategory.}

\item{splineomics2}{A second SplineOmics result object to compare against the
first.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
  \item{correlation_summary}{A data frame summarizing the correlation between
    the two objects per category and subcategory. Columns include `category`,
    `subcategory`, `n_common` (number of shared features), and
    `correlation` (Spearman rho).}
  \item{plots}{A named list of ggplot objects visualizing the correlation
    of `-log10(adj.P.Val)` values for each matched subcategory.}
}
}
\description{
This function compares the `adj.P.Val` values from two SplineOmics analysis
objects by matching features across three categories of topTables:
`time_effect`, `avrg_diff_conditions`, and `interaction_condition_time`.
For each matching subcategory, it calculates the Spearman correlation
of adjusted p-values (`adj.P.Val`) for shared features and creates
scatter plots of `-log10(adj.P.Val)` between the two analyses.
