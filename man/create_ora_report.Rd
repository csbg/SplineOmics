\title{Generate an HTML report for over-representation analysis results}
\usage{
create_ora_report(
  report_payload,
  report_info = NULL,
  cluster_hits_report_name = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  report_dir = here::here()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{report_payload}{\code{list}:
A structured ORA report payload as returned by \code{run_ora()}. It must
contain the raw enrichment results and all metadata required for report
generation.}

\item{report_info}{\code{list} | \code{NULL}:
Optional list with experiment metadata used to annotate the HTML report
(e.g., omics data type, project name, analyst, and data description). If
\code{NULL}, a minimal report is generated.}

\item{cluster_hits_report_name}{\code{character(1)} | \code{NULL}:
Optional name of the \code{cluster_hits()} report that produced the
clustering results used for ORA. When provided, it is displayed in the
report to document provenance.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical(1)}:
Logical flag controlling the display of progress and status messages.}

\item{report_dir}{\code{character(1)}:
Directory where the HTML report and all associated output files are
written. The directory is created if it does not already exist.}
}
\value{
A named list of \code{ggplot} objects containing the ORA dotplots generated
for the report. Each element is named after the corresponding grouping
column in the cluster table, allowing easy identification and reuse of the
plots outside the HTML report.
}
\description{
This function generates an HTML report for over-representation analysis
(ORA) results produced by \code{run_ora()}. It consumes a structured
\code{report_payload} object and creates dotplots summarizing enrichment
results for each grouping column in the cluster table.

The function is responsible for all visualization and reporting side
effects. Statistical analysis is not recomputed. Calling this function
implies that an HTML report should be generated; therefore, a valid output
directory must be provided.
