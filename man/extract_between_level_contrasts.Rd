\title{Extract pairwise contrasts for a condition from a fitted limma model}
\usage{
extract_between_level_contrasts(fit_obj, condition)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_obj}{A list containing:
- `fit`: fitted model object from `lmFit()` or `dream()`
- `meta`: sample metadata used in the model
- `design_matrix`: the design matrix used for fitting
- `feature_names`: optional row annotations
- `condition`: the condition factor used
- `padjust_method`: method for p-value adjustment}

\item{condition}{A string indicating the column in `meta` that contains
the condition factor for which pairwise contrasts should be extracted.}
}
\value{
A named list with two elements:
  - `condition_only`: average condition-level differences
  - `condition_time`: condition Ã— time interaction effects

Each is itself a list of results for all level combinations.
}
\description{
Internal helper function that extracts condition-only and interaction
contrasts for all pairwise combinations of levels within a condition
factor. Works with fitted limma or dream models stored in a structured
list returned by a global model fitting function.
