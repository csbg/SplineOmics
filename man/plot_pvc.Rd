\title{Plot Peaks and Valleys in Time-Series Omics Data}
\usage{
plot_pvc(pvc_pvals, data, meta, meta_batch_column, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric matrix, where rows correspond to features (e.g., genes, 
proteins, metabolites) and columns correspond to samples.}

\item{meta}{A data frame containing metadata for the samples. Must include
a column named `"Time"` that specifies the timepoint for each sample.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value specifying the significance threshold 
for displaying stars above excursion points. Defaults to `0.05`.}

\item{results}{A list returned from `detect_excursions()`, containing 
`results_df` (excursion matrix) and `pairwise_pvals` (one-tailed p-values for 
the excursion contrast).}

\item{meta_replicates_column}{A character string specifying the column name 
in `meta` that indicates biological replicates.}
}
\value{
A named list of ggplot objects, where each element corresponds to a 
feature with at least one detected excursion. Each plot displays the 
expression levels across timepoints, with replicates distinguished by shape.
}
\description{
This function generates scatter plots for features that exhibit significant 
local peaks or valleys (excursions) in time-series omics data. Excursion 
points are highlighted in red, while normal points remain grey. If the 
excursion is statistically significant (based on the compound contrast test), 
a significance star is shown directly above the excursion point.
