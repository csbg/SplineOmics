\title{Mean Correlation with Time Plot}
\usage{
plot_mean_correlation_with_time(data, meta, condition)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame where rows are features and columns are samples.}

\item{meta}{A data frame with sample metadata. Must contain a column "Time".}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing the distribution of mean correlations
 with time.
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame with time series data 
(rows as features and columns as samples)
