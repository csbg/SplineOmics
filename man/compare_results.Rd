\title{Compare hits between two SplineOmics results}
\usage{
compare_results(
  splineomics1,
  splineomics2,
  splineomics1_description = "SplineOmics_1",
  splineomics2_description = "SplineOmics_2",
  adj_p_tresh1 = 0.05,
  adj_p_tresh2 = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{splineomics1}{A list containing `limma_splines_result` with topTables
organized by category and subcategory.}

\item{splineomics2}{Same structure as `splineomics1`; the object to compare.}

\item{splineomics1_description}{Character label used for x-axis annotation.}

\item{splineomics2_description}{Character label used for y-axis annotation.}

\item{adj_p_tresh1}{Numeric p-value threshold for calling hits in analysis 1.}

\item{adj_p_tresh2}{Numeric p-value threshold for calling hits in analysis 2.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
  \item{correlation_summary}{Data frame of global and hit-level correlations}
  \item{plots}{Named list of ggplot objects for all and hit-only subsets.}
  \item{hits_summary}{Data frame with hit counts, overlap, and Jaccard index}
}
}
\description{
Compares adjusted p-values from two SplineOmics result objects across
standard categories. Calculates Spearman correlation globally and for
significant hits only, generates diagnostic plots, and summarizes
overlap statistics including Jaccard index and hit counts.

Note: The feature_names columns in the topTables of splineomics1 and 
splineomics2 must have the same names, otherwise, no comparisons are 
possible.
