\usage{
preprocess_rna_seq_data(splineomics, normalize_func = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{splineomics}{An S3 object of class `SplineOmics` that must contain the 
following elements:
\itemize{
  \item \code{data}: A matrix of the omics dataset, with feature names 
  optionally as row headers (genes as rows, samples as columns).
  \item \code{meta}: A dataframe containing metadata corresponding to the 
  \code{data}. The dataframe must include a 'Time' column and a column 
  specified by the \code{condition}.
  \item \code{design}: A character string representing the design formula 
  for the limma analysis (e.g., \code{'~ 1 + Phase*X + Reactor'}).
  \item \code{spline_params}: A list of spline parameters used in the 
  analysis. This can include:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{spline_type}: A character string specifying the type of 
      spline. Must be either \code{'n'} for natural cubic splines or 
      \code{'b'} for B-splines.
      \item \code{dof}: An integer specifying the degrees of freedom. 
      Required for both natural cubic splines and B-splines.
      \item \code{degree}: An integer specifying the degree of the spline 
      (for B-splines only).
      \item \code{knots}: Positions of the internal knots (for B-splines).
      \item \code{bknots}: Boundary knots (for B-splines).
    }
  \item \code{use_array_weights}: Boolean flag indicating if the robust fit
   strategy to deal with heteroscedasticity should be used or not. If set to
   NULL, then this is handeled implicitly based on the result of the Levene
   test. If this test is significant for at least 10% of the features,
   then the robust strategy is used. The robust strategy uses the function
   voomWithQualityWeights for RNA-seq data instead of the normal voom
   function. For other, non-count-based data, the function 
   limma::arrayWeights is used instead, combined with setting the robust
   argument to TRUE for the limma::eBayes function. In summary, the strategy
   employed by those functions is to downweights samples with higher
   variance. This can be neccessary, because linear models have the
   assumption of homoscedasticity, which means that the variance is
   (approx.) the same across all datapoints where the linear model is fitted.
    If this is violated, then the resulting p-values cannot be trusted
   (common statistical wisdom).
  \item \code{bp_cfg}: A named numeric vector specifying the parallelization
  configuration, with expected names `"n_cores"` and `"blas_threads"`.
  
  This controls how many **R worker processes** (`n_cores`) and how many
  **BLAS/OpenBLAS threads per process** (`blas_threads`) should be used
  during parallel computation.  
  
  If `bp_cfg` is `NULL`, missing, or any of its required fields is
  `NA`, both `n_cores` and `blas_threads` default to `1`. This effectively
  disables parallelization and avoids oversubscription of CPU threads.
}}

\item{normalize_func}{An optional normalization function. If provided, this
function will be used to normalize the `DGEList` object. If not provided,
TMM normalization (via `edgeR::calcNormFactors`) will be used by default.
Must take as
input the y of: y <- edgeR::DGEList(counts = raw_counts) and output the y
with the normalized counts.}
}
\value{
The updaed `splineomics` object, now containing the `voom` object, 
which includes the log2-counts per million (logCPM) matrix and 
observation-specific weights. Additionally, the splineparams are updated with
the identified optimal dof based on LOOCV, when dof = 0L (for auto-dof)
}
\description{
The `preprocess_rna_seq_data()` function performs essential preprocessing
steps for raw RNA-seq counts. This includes creating a `DGEList` object,
normalizing the counts using the default TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values)
normalization via the `edgeR::calcNormFactors` function, and applying the
`voom` transformation from the `limma` package to obtain log-transformed
counts per million (logCPM) with associated precision weights. If you
require a different normalization method, you can supply your own
custom normalization function.
