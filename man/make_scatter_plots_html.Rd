\usage{
make_scatter_plots_html(
  data,
  meta,
  output_file = "scatter_report",
  meta_replicate_column = NULL,
  features_per_file = 500
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix with features as rows and samples as columns. 
Row names should be feature names.}

\item{meta}{A data frame with the meta information. Must contain a numeric
column "Time".}

\item{output_file}{The name of the HTML output file.}

\item{meta_replicate_column}{Column name of the column in meta that contains
the info about the replicates, such as reactor.}

\item{features_per_file}{Integer specifying how many features (for example
proteins) should be plotted per file. Per default
500.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns `NULL`. This function is called for its side effects:
it renders one or more HTML reports to the **current working directory**,
named `paste0(output_file, "_chunk_", i, ".html")` for chunk index `i`,
and prints progress messages during generation.
}
\description{
This function is used to make scatter plots for the raw data of all the 
features. It generates an HTML report in the fashion of the other functions
of the SplineOmics package which contains all the scatter plots.

\examples{
# Create toy data: 3 features Ã— 6 samples
set.seed(123)
toy_data <- matrix(
  rnorm(18, mean = 5, sd = 2),
  nrow = 3,
  ncol = 6,
  dimnames = list(
    c("geneA", "geneB", "geneC"),
    paste0("sample", 1:6)
  )
)

# Meta data: must include a numeric Time column
toy_meta <- data.frame(
  Time = rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 2),
  Replicate = rep(c("R1", "R2"), times = 3),
  row.names = colnames(toy_data)
)

# Write HTML reports into a temporary directory

  data = toy_data,
  meta = toy_meta,
  output_file = "scatter_demo",
  meta_replicate_column = "Replicate",
  features_per_file = 2
)
