\usage{
find_pvc(
  splineomics,
  alphas = 0.05,
  padjust_method = "BH",
  support = 1,
  plot_info = list(y_axis_label = "Value", time_unit = "min", treatment_labels = NA,
    treatment_timepoints = NA),
  report_dir = here::here()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{splineomics}{A list containing the preprocessed time-series
input data. Must include named elements `"data"` (a numeric matrix),
`"meta"` (a metadata data frame with a `"Time"` column),
`"meta_batch_column"` (name of the column in `meta` identifying
replicates or batches), and `"padjust_method"` (a string specifying
the method for p-value adjustment).}

\item{alphas}{A single numeric value or a named list of numeric
thresholds used to identify significant excursion points. If a single
value is provided (numeric scalar or list of length 1), the same
threshold is applied to all condition levels. If a named list is
provided, it must contain one numeric value per condition level, with
names matching the condition levels exactly. This input is normalized
internally to ensure consistent per-level access.}

\item{padjust_method}{A character string specifying the method for
multiple testing correction. Defaults to `"BH"`
(Benjamini-Hochberg).}

\item{support}{Minimum amount of non-NA values in each timepoint that
influence a PVC-test result. For example, with timepoints 10, 15, 20
and support = 1, then for timepoint 15 for a given feature, the
timepoints 10, 15, and 20 each must have at least 1 non-NA value. If
one or more of those timepoints for that feature don't meet this
criterium, then the p-value for that feature at timepoint 15 is set
to NA.}

\item{plot_info}{List with elements y_axis_label (string), time_unit
(string), treatment_labels (character vector), and
treatment_timepoints (integer vector). All can also be NA. This list
is used to add this info to the spline plots. time_unit labels the
x-axis; treatment_labels and -timepoints add vertical dashed lines,
showing treatment positions (e.g. feeding, temperature shift).}

\item{report_dir}{Character string specifying the directory path
where the HTML report and any other output files should be saved.}
}
\value{
A named list of ggplot objects, where each element corresponds
to a feature with at least one detected peak or valley. Each plot
shows expression profiles across timepoints, highlights excursions in
red, and annotates significant excursions with significance stars.
}
\description{
Identifies significant local peaks or valleys (excursions) in
time-series omics data using a Union-Intersection Test (UIT)-based
approach. This function wraps the detection and plotting steps,
returning visualizations of all features with at least one excursion.
}
\details{
A peak or valley is a timepoint whose expression value is
significantly different from both its neighbors and deviates in the
same direction: either significantly higher than both (a peak) or
significantly lower than both (a valley).

Statistically, this is tested with a compound contrast in limma:
(T - T_prev) + (T - T_next) = 2T - T_prev - T_next. The contrast has
power only when `T` is an outlier vs. both neighbors in the same
direction. The resulting p-value is FDR-adjusted and compared to
`alpha`.

- Validates inputs via `check_splineomics_elements()` and
  `InputControl`.
- Detects local excursions using `pvc_test()`.
- Displays the number of total excursion hits found.
- Generates plots with `plot_pvc()`, marking excursion significance
  by the chosen `alpha`.
