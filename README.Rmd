The R package `SplineOmics` finds the significant features (hits) of
time-series -omics data by using splines and `limma` for hypothesis
testing. It then clusters the hits based on the spline shape while showing all results in summary HTML reports.

## 📘 Introduction

Welcome to `SplineOmics`, an R package designed to streamline the
analysis of -omics time-series data, followed by automated HTML report
generation.

### Is the SplineOmics package of use for me?

If you have -omics data over time, the package will help you to run
`limma` with splines, decide on which parameters to use, perform the
clustering, run GSEA and show result plots in HTML reports. Any time-series data that is a valid input to the `limma` package is also a valid input to the `SplineOmics` package (such as transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, metabolomics, etc.).

### What do I need precisely?

1.  A data matrix where each row is a feature (e.g., protein,
    metabolite, etc.) and each column is a sample taken at a specific
    time.

2.  A table with identifiers on the rows/features of the data matrix
    (e.g., gene and protein name)

3.  A table with metadata on the columns/samples of the data matrix
    (e.g., batch, time point, etc.)

### Capabilities

With `SplineOmics`, you can:

- **Automatically perform exploratory data analysis:**

  The `explore_data()` function generates an HTML report, containing
  various plots, such as density, PCA, and correlation heatmap plots.

- **Explore various limma splines hyperparameters:**

  Test combinations of hyperparameters, such as different datasets,
  `limma` design formulas, degrees of freedom, p-value thresholds, etc.,
  using the `screen_limma_hyperparams()` function.

- **Perform limma spline analysis:**

  Use the `run_limma_splines()` function to perform the `limma` analysis
  with splines once the optimal hyperparameters are identified.

- **Cluster significant features:**

  Cluster the significant features (hits) identified in the spline
  analysis with the `cluster_hits()` function.

- **Run GSEA with clustered hits:**

  Perform gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the clustered hits
  with the `create_gsea_report()` function.

- **Generate reports:**

  Automatically generate reports to showcase all results.

## 🔧 Installation

Follow the steps below to install the `SplineOmics` package from the GitHub
repository into your R environment. 

#### Prerequisites

- Ensure **R** is installed on your system. If not, download and install
  it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
- **RStudio** is recommended for a more user-friendly experience with R.
  Download and install RStudio from
  [posit.co](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

#### Installation Steps

1.  **Open RStudio** or your R console.

2.  **Install** `SplineOmics` **from
    GitHub** with all dependencies.

Copy and paste the following code block into your R console or run it as
a script. 

> **Note for Windows Users:**  
> Please read the text below this code block before running it!

``` r
# Function to ensure a package is installed
ensure_installed <- function(pkg) {
  if (!requireNamespace(pkg, quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(pkg)
  }
}

# Install packages if not already available
ensure_installed("BiocManager")
ensure_installed("remotes")

# Load packages
library(BiocManager)
library(remotes)

# Install Bioconductor dependencies
BiocManager::install(c(
  "ComplexHeatmap",
   "clusterProfiler",
   "limma"
  ), force = TRUE)

# Delete once repo is public
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "your_GitHub_PAT")

# Install SplineOmics from GitHub
remotes::install_github(
  "csbg/SplineOmics@ad35d9aef2e8a8b19572c83ec771f4d92b343a4e",
  dependencies = TRUE,  # Install all dependencies
  force = TRUE,         # Force reinstallation
  upgrade = "always",   # Always upgrade dependencies
)

# Verify the installation
if ("SplineOmics" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
  message("SplineOmics installed successfully.")
} else {
  message("SplineOmics installation failed.")
}
```

Note that when some installation paths are not writable on **Windows**, it is necessary running `RStudio` as administrator once for the installation. Otherwise, set up a library path (code block below) for the installation and (re)run the code block above.

```r
# Create a directory for R libraries
dir.create("~/Rlibs", showWarnings = FALSE)

# Set the library path to include the new directory
.libPaths(c("~/Rlibs", .libPaths()))
```

3.  **Load the `SplineOmics` package**:

Once the installation is complete, load the `SplineOmics` package into
your R session or script to start using it:

``` r
library(SplineOmics)
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors related to dependencies or package versions
during installation, try updating your R and RStudio to the latest
versions and repeat the installation steps.

For issues specifically related to the `SplineOmics` package, check the
[Issues section](https://github.com/%3Cuser%3E/%3Crepo%3E/issues) of the
GitHub repository for similar problems or to post a new issue.

### 🐳 Docker Container

Alternatively, you can run your analysis in a `Docker` container. The underlying `Docker` image
encapsulates the `SplineOmics` package together with the necessary
environment and dependencies. This ensures higher levels of reproducibility because the analysis is carried out in a consistent environment, independent of the operating system and its custom configurations.

More information about `Docker` containers can be found on the [official Docker page](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/).

For instructions on downloading the image of the `SplineOmics` package and running the container, please refer to the
[Docker instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csbg/SplineOmics/main/doc/Docker_instructions.html).

## ▶️ Usage

### Tutorial

[This
tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csbg/SplineOmics/main/doc/get-started.html)
