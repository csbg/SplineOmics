The R package `SplineOmics` finds the significant features (hits) of time-series -omics data by using splines and `limma` for hypothesis testing. It then clusters the hits based on the spline shape while showing all results in summary HTML reports.

## 📘 Introduction

Welcome to `SplineOmics`, an R package designed to streamline the analysis of -omics time-series data, followed by automated HTML report generation.

### Is the SplineOmics package of use for me?

If you have -omics data over time, the package will help you to run `limma` with splines, perform the clustering, run ORA and show result plots in HTML reports. Any time-series data that is a valid input to the `limma` package is also a valid input to the `SplineOmics` package (such as transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, metabolomics, glycan fractional abundances, etc.).

### What do I need precisely?

1.  **Data**: A data matrix where each row is a feature (e.g., protein, metabolite, etc.) and each column is a sample taken at a specific time. The data must have no NA values, should have normally distributed features and no dependence between the samples.

2.  **Meta**: A table with metadata on the columns/samples of the data matrix (e.g., batch, time point, etc.)

3.  **Annotation** (optional): A table with identifiers on the rows/features of the data matrix (e.g., gene and protein name).

### Capabilities

With `SplineOmics`, you can:

-   **Automatically perform exploratory data analysis:**

    The `explore_data()` function generates an HTML report, containing various plots, such as density, PCA, and correlation heatmap plots ([example report](https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics_html_reports/explore_data_PTX.html)).

-   **Perform limma spline analysis:**

    Use the `run_limma_splines()` function to perform the `limma` analysis with splines once the optimal hyperparameters are identified ([example report](https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics_html_reports/create_limma_report_PTX.html)).

-   **Find jumps and drops in the timecourse:**

    Use the `find_pvc()` function for that ([example report](https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics_html_reports/pvc_report_PPTX.html)).

-   **Cluster significant features:**

    Cluster the significant features (hits) identified in the spline analysis with the `cluster_hits()` function ([example report](https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics_html_reports/report_clustered_hits_PTX.html)).

-   **Run ORA with clustered hits:**

    Perform over-representation analysis (ORA) using the clustered hits with the `run_ora()` function ([example report](https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics_html_reports/run_ora_report.html)).

## 🔧 Installation

Follow the steps below to install the `SplineOmics` package from the GitHub repository into your R environment.

> **Note**
Carefully read the terminal messages of the installations. It can happen that 
installations fail due to missing dependencies, which you then must resolve
using other commands not necessarily written down here.

#### Prerequisites

-   Ensure **R** is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
-   **RStudio** is recommended for a more user-friendly experience with R. Download and install RStudio from [posit.co](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

#### Installation Steps

> **Note for Windows Users:**

During the installation on Windows, you might see a message indicating that Rtools is not installed, which is typically required for compiling R packages from source. However, for this installation, Rtools is not necessary, and you can safely ignore this message.

1.  **Open RStudio** or your R console in a new or existing project folder.

2. Create a **virtual environment** with `renv`

``` r
renv::init()
```

3.  **Install `BiocManager`** for Bioconductor dependencies (if not already installed)

``` r
install.packages("BiocManager")
```

4. Install required Bioconductor packages

``` r
BiocManager::install(
  c("ComplexHeatmap", "limma", "variancePartition")
  # force = TRUE   # when encountering issues
)
```

5.  Install `remotes` for GitHub package installation

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

5.  **Install** the **`SplineOmics`** package from GitHub and all
its non-Bioconductor dependencies, using `remotes`

``` r
remotes::install_github(
  "csbg/SplineOmics",   # GitHub repository
  ref = "<tag>",        # Version to install, e.g. v0.4.2 
  dependencies = TRUE,  # Install all dependencies
  upgrade = "always"    # Always upgrade dependencies
  # force = TRUE        # when encountering issues
)
```

6.  **Verify** the **installation** of the `SplineOmics` package:

``` r
pkg <- "SplineOmics"
ver <- "0.4.2"

status <- tryCatch({
  library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
  packageVersion(pkg) == ver
}, error = function(e) FALSE)

if (status) {
  message(sprintf("%s version %s is installed correctly.", pkg, ver))
} else {
  message(sprintf("%s version %s is NOT installed correctly.", pkg, ver))
}
```

📌 **Note on documentation:**  
The website only contains the documentation for the most recent `SplineOmics`
version. To get the documentation of any currently installed version, run:

``` r
help(package="SplineOmics")
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors related to dependencies or package versions during installation, try updating your R and RStudio to the latest versions and repeat the installation steps.

For issues specifically related to the `SplineOmics` package, check the [Issues section](https://github.com/csbg/SplineOmics/issues) of the GitHub repository for similar problems or to post a new issue.

### 🐳 Docker Container

Alternatively, you can run your analysis in a `Docker` container. The underlying `Docker` image encapsulates the `SplineOmics` package together with the necessary environment and dependencies. This ensures higher levels of reproducibility because the analysis is carried out in a consistent environment, independent of the operating system and its custom configurations.

Please note that you must have the `Docker Engine` installed on your machine. For instructions on how to install it, consult the official [Docker Engine installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

More information about `Docker` containers can be found on the [official Docker page](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/).

For instructions on downloading the image of the `SplineOmics` package and running the container, please refer to the [Docker instructions](https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics/articles/Docker-instructions.html).

An explanation of the three different `limma` results is [here](https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics/articles/limma_result_categories.html).

### 🧬 RNA-seq and Glycan Data {#rna-seq-and-glycan-data}

#### RNA-seq data

Transcriptomics data must be preprocessed for `limma`. You need to provide an appropriate object, such as a `voom` object, in the `rna_seq_data` argument of the `SplineOmics` object (see [documentation](https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics/reference/create_splineomics.html)). Along with this, the normalized matrix (e.g., the `$E` slot of the `voom` object) must be passed to the `data` argument. This allows flexibility in preprocessing; you can use any method you prefer as long as the final object and matrix are compatible with limma. One way to preprocess your RNA-seq data is by using the `preprocess_rna_seq_data()` function included in the `SplineOmics` package (see [documentation](https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics/reference/preprocess_rna_seq_data.html)).

[Here](https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics/articles/RNA-seq%20analysis.html) you can find an example analysis of RNA-seq data with the SplineOmics package.

#### Glycan fractional abundance data

The glycan fractional abundance data matrix, where each row represents a type of glycan and the columns correspond to timepoints, must be transformed before analysis. This preprocessing step is essential due to the compositional nature of the data. In compositional data, an increase in the abundance of one component (glycan) necessarily results in a decrease in others, introducing a dependency among the variables that can bias the analysis. One way to address this issue is by applying the Centered Log Ratio (CLR) transformation to the data with the clr function from the compositions package:

``` r
library(compositions)
clr_transformed_data <- clr(data_matrix)  # use as SplineOmics input
```

The results from clr transformed data can be harder to understand and interpret however. If you prefer ease of interpretation and are fine that the results contain some artifacts due to the compositional nature of the data, log2 transform your data instead and use that as input for the `SplineOmics` package.

``` r
log2_transformed_data <- log2(data_matrix)  # use as SplineOmics input
```

### R Version

Depending on the version of `SplineOmics`, for the most recent, 4.5.0 or higher.
