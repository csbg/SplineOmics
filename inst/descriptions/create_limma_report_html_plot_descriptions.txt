Features that have a significant time effect have a spline that shows a temporal pattern (the degree of temporal pattern that is sufficient for this depends on the adj.p-value threshold) within one level (then they are significant for that level). If the spline fit to the time course of a feature within a level is more or less flat over time, it will not a significant feature (hit) in this limma result category.

Features that have a significant average difference between two conditions (when there are more then two, all of them are compared pairwise) have different oveall y-axis values for the spline in the compared levels. For example, if the time course of a given feature is on overage around 17 in one level, but around 11 in the other level, this could be a significant feature (hit) in this limma result category (irrespective of the temporal pattern of this feature in any or the compared levels).

Features that have a significant interaction of condition and time have a different temporal pattern of their spline in both compared levels. For example, if the spline curve goes up in level 1 of the comparison, but goes down in level 2, this could be a significant feature (hit) in this limma result category.
