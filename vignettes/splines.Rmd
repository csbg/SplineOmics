Here an example of a hit (significant feature) with the datapoints in blue and the applied natural cubic spline in red:

<img src="inst/extdata/significant_feature.png" width="200" height="200"/>

The datapoints of the triplicates are close together and there is a clear temporal pattern. This is from a proteomics example, so this protein here would decrease in abundance over the timecourse.

Here an example of a feature, that is not significant (no hit):

<img src="inst/extdata/non_significant_feature.png" width="200" height="200"/>

The datapoints are scattered and there is no clear temporal pattern. The conclusion for this protein would be that there is no significant change in abundance over the timecourse.
