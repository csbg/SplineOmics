### [0.3.0]

#### Changed
- cluster_hits() returns. Now it returns only the plots and a large table, 
  summarizing all clustering results, including the results from the limma
  result categories 2 and 3. 

- run_ora() now takes the cluster_hits() summary table return as input, and
  performs enrichment analysis with all three limma result categories.

- More info in run_ora() reports: The HTML reports generated by the run_ora()
  function contained too little information about the inputs and the results to
  which the ora report is connected. To adress this, the ora report now contains              downloadable files with the foreground and background genes, reports the
  clusterProfiler parameters used, and the run_ora() function has a new argument
  which allows to pass a string which is the name of the corresponding
  cluster_hits() HTML report, that contains the results that are the basis for
  the respective run_ora() report.
  
- Separated isolated and integrated mode computations: Before, there was a part
  in the code that generated the limma time_effect category results.
  This was used both for the isolated and integrated mode, because they share 
  those results. However, this meant that the analysis for the integrated mode
  was run more often then necessary, because it was run once for each condition
  to the the time_effect results, and then once to get the average diff 
  condition and interaction results.
  This was unnecessary, since all the integrated results can be derived with a
  single global model (with the help of contrasts). Therefore, I now completely
  separated the compuations for the isolated and integrated approach, and for
  the integrated approach, just one global model is run and all the three limma
  result categories extracted from there with the help of contrasts.

- Made cluster_hits() usable for many hits: Introduced a new function argument,
  called max_hit_number. This controls the plotting logic of the report 
  generation, so it limits the amount of plots and amount of detail shown in the
  plots to a maximum number of hits per cluster. This allows to also generate
  clustering reports for analyses with many hits, because nowbody anyways looks
  at thousands of spline plots.

- Switched from hierarchical clustering to kmeans. This was done because kmeans
  is much faster (more efficient in terms of computations). Also, now the number
  of clusters is always specified as a range (min:max, e.g. 2:4) and all of 
  those cluster numbers are tried out and the best one identified with the help
  of the silhuette score. Also if you want to have just one definite amount of
  clusters, you still specify it as a range due to technical reasons. 
  Additionally, when the datasets is large, it uses the minibatch version of
  kmeans, which is a lot faster (while sacrificing a bit of the cluster 
  quality).
  
#### Added
- Auto-dof with loocv: Introduced new capability, that automatically finds the 
  best spline dof based on the error on loocv. For every linear model fit, it 
  performs the analytical loocv and then looks at the error sum of all features.
  It does this with every dof from 2 to min(timepoints, 10). Autodof is
  activated when the the dof = 0L is selected.

- Added cross-species gene mapping: Added optional support for automatic gene
  symbol conversion between species via gprofiler2 or orthogene. Controlled
  through the new mapping_cfg argument in run_ora(), this enables mapping from
  from_species to to_species using either method. The conversion applies across
  all cluster hit tables, preserves order, and retains unmapped genes. No suffix
  stripping is done, but users are warned if trailing _digits are detected. The
  qvalue package is now optionally required to enable stricter FDR filtering in
  enrichment results.

- Cross-platform and memory-safe parallelization support for dream() via a new
  helper function bp_setup(). This function sets up a BiocParallel backend using
  either MulticoreParam (Unix) or SnowParam (Windows), based on user-supplied 
  configuration (bp_cfg). BLAS threads per worker are throttled using 
  RhpcBLASctl to avoid oversubscription. Cleanup with bpstop() is conditionally
  applied for SnowParam backends. Includes validation of bp_cfg input. Enables
  efficient multi-core execution of dream() and eBayes() while preventing system
  resource exhaustion.
  
- download_bioconductor_database() function.
  This one allows to conveniently download a database from a specific organism
  from BioConductor (see function documentation).

- Introduced clusterProfiler::enrichGO() along with clusterProfiler::simplify
  into SplineOmics::run_ora(). This allows to run the enrichment of the 
  BioConductor GO databases with the enrichGO function, followed by the simplify
  function, to collapse hierarchical terms. This behavior is controlled over a
  new argument of run_ora(), namely enrichGO_cfg (see documentation).

- Better documentation in the limma and cluster_hits HTML reports about the 
  heteroscedasticity arguments and the result of the Levene test.

#### Fixed
- Red spline curves: Before, it was just generated with the help of the spline
  coefficients, and the intercept. But this is not the full linear model that
  is used by limma. Now, it generates the spline also with the help of the 
  other variables used in the linear model. The predicted splines are now 
  generated at the very beginning of the cluster_hits() function, and used for
  clustering AND plotting. 
  
- Wrong coefficients passes to topTable() function. 
  For the limma result category average difference conditions, not all necessary
  coefficients were passed. Before, it just checked if there is a difference 
  between the conditions for the reference time point (the first timepoint). Now
  it passes all the necessary coefficients, and then performs a joint F-test to
  get the average difference between the conditions across the whole timecourse.
  
- The use_array_weights argument internally was always set to FALSE when it was
  set to TRUE by the user. This is why setting it to TRUE seemingly had no 
  effect. This was now fixed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [0.2.0] - 2025-05-08

#### Fixed
- Bug that prevented the generation of the double spline plots when the 
  condition column of meta was a factor instead of a string. This is now solved
  (it internally in the code converts it to a string), so having the condition
  column as a factor now does not cause problems anymore (as having it as 
  factor is perfectly valid).
  
- Bug that occured in the internal clean_gene_symbols() function when one of 
  the gene names was NA. Now, this does not cause a problem anymore and instead
  of the gene name on the respective spline plot it will write NA.
  
- The error message when more clusters where specified than hits in a condition
  was very cryptic. Now, it gives a message that is easy to understand.

- A bug in input control that threw an error indicating that there are rows in 
  the dataset that contains just zeros, even though this was not true.

- When running cluster_hits() with report = FALSE, but there where many hits, it
  anyways warned the user that the report generation will take long. This was
  fixed, because when report = FALSE, no report is generated, which means the 
  user does not have to be warned then (that would just confuse the user).

#### Changed
- Replicates in the double spline plots (limma result category 2 and 3) are now
  shown with shapes instead of numbers besides the data points. This is now 
  possible because the imputed values are not anymore shown with shapes in 
  those plots, like in the single spline plots (limma result category 1), but 
  with colors (red = imputed values for condition 1, dodgerblue = imputed
  values for condition 2).
  
- The images in the HTML reports are now considerably smaller, but zoomable, 
  with the option to drag within the zoomed image. A single left-click with the 
  mouse starts the zoom process. Then, you can zoom with the mouse wheel. If you
  reach the max zoom, you can move in the image by further zooming with the 
  mouse wheel but placing the mouse in one of the corners. Further, one can zoom
  by holding left-click pressed and dragging (you can then also let go).
  
- SplineOmics can now handle datasets with NA values. limma can do that, and 
  since SplineOmics is based on limma, it can in principle do it to. The issue 
  before was just that there were checks in place that prevented NA values from
  entering the pipeline, and also other steps in the code caused problems,
  raised warnings, or stopped the execution when facing NA values.
  
- Changed extract_data() function so that it can handle missing values 
  correctly, and so that it now is fully explicit and does not do any internal
  magic.

- When there where less than two hits in all levels for the cluster_hits()
  function, then this function provided a message that informed about this and
  threw an error. This was fine when just running the function to generate one
  result. However, when using this function in an outside loop to generate
  multiple results, this behavior is suboptimal, because it then must be 
  captured with a tryCatch clause. Now, if there are less than two hits in all
  levels, it simply returns NULL, which is a cleaner behavior that does not 
  break loops if one result cannot be generated.

- extract_data() function, so that now it does not work with an implicit logic,
  but instead with an explicit logic. Before, it tried to automatically find the
  numeric matrix field. Now, it requires to specific the top- and bottom row,
  and the left and right column. This then marks the field where the matrix is.
  The rest of the logic (the logic about the row name columns) is still the
  same.

- make_scatter_plot_html() (now renamed to make_scatter_plots_html()).

- renamed run_gsea() to run_ora(), because the function uses clusterProfiler,
  which performs ora (overrepresentation analysis) and not gsea (gene set 
  enrichment analysis) in the stricter sense.
  
### Added
- find_pvc() function. This function performs a compount contrast for every 
  timepoint triple in the data (adjacent timepoints) to find peaks, valley, and
  cliffs as a form of local temporal patterns. It generates an HTML report
  containing all findings in files and also containing the plots.

- New vignette showcasing the find_pvc() function.
  
- Implicit (default) and explicit heteroscedasticity handling of the linear model input. Controlled by the `robust_fit` Boolean flag indicating whether the robust modeling strategy should be used to account for heteroscedasticity. If omitted (i.e., `robust_fit = NULL`), the decision is made implicitly based on the result of the Breusch–Pagan test, which is applied independently to each feature. This test fits a linear model of the form `expression ~ time` and checks whether the residual variance systematically depends on the fitted values. If a significant violation of homoscedasticity is detected in a sufficient fraction of features (default: 10%), the robust strategy is applied. For RNA-seq data, this means using `voomWithQualityWeights()` instead of the standard `voom()` function. For other, non-count-based data, `limma::arrayWeights()` is used during model fitting, combined with `robust = TRUE` in `limma::eBayes()`. These strategies downweight samples with higher residual variance to prevent bias in the linear modeling step, as violations of the homoscedasticity assumption can lead to misleading p-values and unreliable inference.

- New note in the HTML report of the cluster_hits() function, that informs the 
  user that the splines shown in
  the plots can appear to have the wrong intercept. This can occur when a batch 
  effect and/or random effect is modeled with limma or the linear mixed models,
  but the plotting data is batch corrected only with the dedicated limma batch 
  correction function. For a reason, there is a gap. The results are fine! Just 
  the plotting is off!
  
- New user-available function called compare_results() that allows to correlate
  the topTable results from two SplineOmics results (for example intergrated 
  vs. isolated approach with the same data).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### [0.1.2] - 2025-02-11

#### Added
- Level name in title of overall spline plots.

#### Fixed
- Small bug that made it impossible having no treatment label for a condition.
- Small bug that did not allow to specify two treatment labels.
- mode == isolated for RNA-seq data. Before, it caused an error, because it
  splits up the meta into the different conditions, but does not do so for the 
  data. Now, it informs the user that it cannot do this, and the user has to
  split up the data himself outside (just for RNA-seq data).

#### Removed
- open_template() function. This was a function that opened a template for your
  own analysis. I removed it, because otherwise, whenever I change the code, I
  have to update the get-started vignette (tutorial) and this, which is twice
  the maintainance effort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [0.1.1] - 2025-01-29

### Changed
- The design formula must now contain the string 'Time' rather than 'X' like it was before. X from
  before stood for the time. This change is intended to make the design formula more explicit and 
  self explanatory.
- Random effects can now be directly be specified in the design formula, rather
  than being passed as part of the dream_params.
  
### Added
- Added linear mixed models for modeling random effects. The variancePartition
  package is used for that --> voomWithDreamWeights for RNA-seq data processing,
  and dream as the replacement for limma. For example, if you Reactor is your
  random effect, you can write the design formula like this:
  design <- "~ 1 + Condition*Time + Plate + (1|Reactor)" and SplineOmics will
  automatically run the variancePartition functions voomWithDreamWeights() and
  dream() instead of the limma::voom and lmfit. dream() has additional
  parameters, such as the method and the degree of freedom (different than the
  degree of freedom used for the splines in this package) and you can pass these
  with the dream_params argument. See RNA-seq analysis vignette or the
  respective function references for more info.
- Raw data plotting function --> make_scatter_plot_html()  --> see references.
- Imputed values are marked with triangle symbols in cluster_hits() spline
  plots if raw data is passed.
- Package version is written in each HTML report (the tag) and the session info
  is added as an embedded text file.
- Standard error written on top of "double spline" plots (limma result category
  2 and 3). 
- Used analysis script is embedded as a text file in the reports.
- The mode (integrated or isolated) is written on top of the reports in a 
  separate field.
- Now there are 4 significance stars.
- Treatment lines for the double spline plots (limma result category 2 and 3).

#### Fixed
- A few smaller visual things for the HTML reports.
