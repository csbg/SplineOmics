# Cluster the significant features based on spline similarity

Performs kmeans clustering of significant features from top tables
generated by limma.

## Usage

``` r
cluster_hits(
  splineomics,
  nr_clusters,
  adj_pthresh_time_effect = 0.05,
  adj_pthresh_avrg_diff_conditions = 0.05,
  adj_pthresh_interaction_condition_time = 0.05,
  min_effect_size = list(time_effect = 0, avg_diff_cond = 0, interaction_cond_time = 0),
  min_cluster_r2 = 0,
  genes = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- splineomics:

  `SplineOmics`: An S3 object of class `SplineOmics` that contains all
  the necessary data and parameters for the analysis, including:

  - `data`: `matrix` The data matrix with the values. The columns are
    the samples (timepoint + replicate combo) and the rows are the
    features (e.g. genes or proteins).

  - `meta`: `data.frame` A dataframe containing metadata corresponding
    to the `data`, must include a 'Time' column and any columns
    specified by `conditions`. In general, the columns of meta
    correspond to the different types of metadata, and each row
    corresponds to a column of data (contains the metadata for that
    sample).

  - `annotation`: `data.frame` A dataframe that maps the rows of `data`
    to annotation info, such as the gene name or database identifiers.

  - `report_info`: `list` A named list describing the experiment. Must
    include the following fields (`character(1)`): -
    `"omics_data_type"` - `"data_description"` -
    `"data_collection_date"` - `"analyst_name"` - `"contact_info"` -
    `"project_name"`

    May also include the following optional fields (`character(1)`): -
    `"method_description"` - `"results_summary"` - `"conclusions"`

  - `design`: `character(1)` A character of length 1 representing the
    limma design formula.

  - `mode`: `character(1)` Specifies how the design formula is
    constructed: either `"isolated"` or `"integrated"`.

    - `"isolated"`: Each level is analyzed independently, using only the
      subset of data corresponding to that level. The design formula
      does not include the condition variable, since only one condition
      is present in each subset.

    - `"integrated"`: All levels are analyzed together in a single
      model, using the full dataset. The design formula includes the
      condition variable (and optionally interaction terms with it) so
      that results are estimated jointly across all levels.

    - `condition`: `character(1)` Character vector of length 1
      specifying the column name in `meta` used to define groups for
      analysis.

    - `spline_params`: `list` A list of spline parameters for the
      analysis.

    - `meta_batch_column`: `character(1)` A character string specifying
      the column name in the metadata used for batch effect removal.

    - `meta_batch2_column`: `character(1)` A character string specifying
      the second column name in the metadata used for batch effect
      removal.

    - `limma_splines_result`: `list(data.frame)` and
      `list(list(data.frame))` A list containing dataframes or lists of
      dataframes. Each df represents a top table from the limma spline
      analysis of the run_limma_splines() function that has to be run
      before.

    - `feature_name_columns`:
      [`character()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html) Character
      vector of strings that each specify a column of the original data
      dataframe which were used to automatically build the feature names
      with the `extract_data` function.

- nr_clusters:

  `list`: Named list specifying the number of clusters per condition
  level. The list must have one element per condition level, and each
  element must be named exactly with the corresponding condition name
  (e.g., `"condition1"`, `"condition2"`).

  Each element's value controls the `k` used by k-means for that level:

  - **Single integer** (`integer(1)`, `k > 0`, e.g. `3`): use exactly
    that many clusters.

  - **Integer range**
    ([`integer()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/integer.html), written with
    `:`, e.g. `2:6`): choose the `k` within the range that **minimizes
    the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)** computed from the k-means
    fit over that range (lower is better). Ties are broken by the first
    minimum encountered.

  **Notes**

  - All condition levels must be present exactly once as names.

  - Values must be positive integers; ranges must be increasing (e.g.
    `2:6`).

  - BIC is computed from k-means using Euclidean distance. A common form
    is \\\mathrm{BIC} = n \log(\mathrm{WCSS}/n) + k \log(n)\\ p\\, where
    \\n\\ is the number of series, \\p\\ the number of timepoints
    (features), and \\\mathrm{WCSS}\\ the total within-cluster sum of
    squares for the fit.

  - Clustering will fail if the requested `k` is not strictly less than
    the number of available series for that level.

  **Example** Fixed k for condition1, BIC-selected k for condition2
  nr_clusters \<- list( condition1 = 4, condition2 = 2:6 )

- adj_pthresh_time_effect:

  `numeric(1)`: adj. p-value threshold for the limma time effect results
  (category 1).

- adj_pthresh_avrg_diff_conditions:

  `numeric(1)`: adj. p-value threshold for the limma average difference
  between conditions results (category 2).

- adj_pthresh_interaction_condition_time:

  `numeric(1)`: adj. p-value threshold for the limma interaction of
  condition and time results (category 3).

- min_effect_size:

  `list`: A named list that specifies the minimum effect size thresholds
  to consider a feature as biologically meaningful, in addition to
  statistical significance. This allows users to filter out "trivial"
  hits that pass adjusted p-value cutoffs but show negligible effect
  sizes.

  The list must contain the following elements:

  - `time_effect`: `numeric(1)` Minimum cumulative travel for time
    effects (Category 1). Features with a smaller travel will be ignored
    even if significant.

  - `avg_diff_cond`: `numeric(1)` Minimum absolute effect size for
    average differences between conditions (Category 2). Ensures that
    only contrasts with a relevant magnitude are reported.

  - `interaction_cond_time`: `numeric(1)` Minimum effect size for the
    interaction between condition and time (Category 3). This controls
    how large the differential curve travel must be across conditions to
    count as a hit.

  Values should be numeric scalars (typically \>0). For example:
  `min_effect_size = list(time_effect = 1, avg_diff_cond = 1, interaction_cond_time = 2)`
  will only keep features with cumulative travels or condition-time
  differences above those cutoffs. Use smaller values (e.g., 0.1) for
  permissive filtering, or larger values for more conservative
  thresholds.

  The default is 0 for all three elements.

- min_cluster_r2:

  `numeric(1)`: A value \>=0 and \<1 specifying the minimum allowed
  squared Pearson correlation (r2) of any cluster member to the centroid
  of its assigned cluster.

  After k-means clustering, each cluster is iteratively pruned. Members
  whose r2 to the current cluster centroid falls below `min_cluster_r2`
  are removed from that cluster and reassigned to cluster `0` (the
  "other" cluster).

  Pruning is repeated until all remaining members satisfy the
  constraint, a maximum of 10 iterations is reached, or the cluster
  would shrink below a minimum size of 10 members. If a cluster cannot
  satisfy the constraint under these conditions, all of its remaining
  members are reassigned to cluster `0`.

  Cluster `0` therefore contains all features that do not meet the
  minimum centroid similarity criterion. These features are retained in
  the output but are not considered part of any valid cluster.

- genes:

  [`character()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html): A character
  vector of gene names corresponding to the features to be analyzed. The
  order of entries must match the feature order in `data`. Gene names
  should be standardized (cleaned) to ensure compatibility with
  downstream databases used for overrepresentation analysis after
  clustering.

- verbose:

  `logical(1)`: Boolean flag controlling the display of messages.

## Value

A named list with three elements:

- `cluster_table`:

  A tibble containing one row per `feature_nr` with metadata and cluster
  assignments across the analysis categories. The structure is:

  - `feature_nr` - Numeric feature identifier.

  - `feature_name` - Preferred feature name, prioritizing values from
    the limma tables, then from the cluster table row names, and falling
    back to the numeric feature ID.

  - `gene` - Preferred gene symbol from the `annotation` table if
    available, otherwise taken from the cluster tables.

  - `cluster_<cond1>` / `cluster_<cond2>` - Cluster assignments for each
    time-effect condition, named according to the elements of
    `clustered_hits_levels`.

  - `cluster_cat2` - Present only if category 2 results are available; a
    combined cluster label in the form
    `"<cluster_<cond1>>_<cluster_<cond2>>"` for features that are
    significant in category 2. If this value is `NA`, the feature was
    not a category 2 hit.

  - `cluster_cat3` - Present only if category 3 results are available; a
    combined cluster label in the form
    `"<cluster_<cond1>>_<cluster_<cond2>>"` for features that are
    significant in category 3. If this value is `NA`, the feature was
    not a category 3 hit.

  For any category-specific cluster column (`cluster_<cond1>`,
  `cluster_<cond2>`, `cluster_cat2`, `cluster_cat3`), a value of `NA`
  indicates that the feature was not significant (not a hit) in that
  category.

- `spline_results`:

  A named list summarizing the fitted spline trajectories, their shared
  time grid, and effect-size based significance flags. Structure:

  `time_grid`

  :   Numeric vector of length \\T\\ giving the common time points
      (e.g., hours since cultivation start) on which all splines were
      predicted.

  `predictions`

  :   Named list by condition (e.g., `constant`, `temp_shift`). Each
      entry is a numeric matrix of size \\N \times T\\ with rows
      corresponding to features and columns to `time_grid`. Values are
      the predicted spline trajectories on the absolute scale used in
      the analysis (e.g., log2-CPM after `voom`). Row order matches the
      feature order used throughout the analysis.

  `time_effect_effect_size`

  :   Named list by condition with a numeric vector (length \\N\\) per
      condition giving the *cumulative travel* (integrated temporal
      change) of each
      feature`s spline across \code{time_grid}. Larger values indicate stronger within-condition temporal modulation.} \item{\code{time_effect_passed_threshold}}{Named list by condition with a logical vector (length \eqn{N}) per condition indicating whether the corresponding \code{time_effect_effect_size} exceeds the user-defined effect-size threshold (i.e., time-effect hits).} \item{\code{interaction_effect_size}}{Numeric vector (length \eqn{N}) giving the \emph{differential cumulative travel} between the two condition-specific splines of each feature, computed on the same \code{time_grid}. Larger values indicate stronger differences in temporal behaviour between conditions (condition-time interaction).} \item{\code{interaction_passed_threshold}}{Logical vector (length \eqn{N}) indicating whether \code{interaction_effect_size} exceeds the interaction effect-size threshold (i.e., features with significantly different temporal profiles across conditions).} } Unless stated otherwise, vectors are aligned to the same feature order used in the prediction matrices; condition names match \code{levels(meta[[condition]])}. } \item{\code{report_payload}}{ A structured list containing all information required to generate downstream clustering reports and visualizations, without recomputing any statistical results. This payload is designed to be consumed by dedicated reporting functions (e.g., \code{create_clustering_report()}) and enables a strict separation between computation and reporting. The contents of \code{report_payload} are intended to be treated as read-only and should not be modified by the user. Any changes to visualization or reporting behavior should be performed by supplying appropriate arguments to the reporting functions rather than altering the payload itself. The payload includes: \describe{ \item{\code{splineomics}}{ The original `SplineOmics`object used for the analysis, providing access to the input data, metadata, design, spline parameters, and analysis settings. } \item{\code{all_levels_clustering}}{ Clustering results for each condition level (Category 1) and, when available, clustering metadata for Categories 2/3. } \item{\code{genes}}{`character()\`
      Vector of gene or feature names corresponding to the analyzed
      features.

  `adj_pthresh_time_effect`

  :   Adjusted p-value threshold used to define significant time-effect
      hits (Category 1).

  `adj_pthresh_avrg_diff_conditions`

  :   Adjusted p-value threshold used for average differences between
      conditions (Category 2).

  `adj_pthresh_interaction_condition_time`

  :   Adjusted p-value threshold used for condition–time interaction
      effects (Category 3).

  `category_2_and_3_hits`

  :   Data structure describing significant features from Categories 2
      and 3 (average differences and interactions), including
      effect-size annotations.

  `min_effect_size`

  :   Named list of effect-size thresholds applied in addition to
      statistical significance.

  `predicted_timecurves`

  :   Predicted spline trajectories and associated summaries (time grid,
      predictions per condition, and effect-size metrics).
