Assess impact temperature shifts temporal patterns: analysis determine whether temporal patterns gene expression affected temperature shift, .e., whether gene expression dynamics differ time temperature shift conditions compared controls.","code":""},{"path":"https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics/articles/RNA-seq-analysis.html","id":"note","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"About this vignette > Analysis Goals","what":"Note","title":"RNA-seq-analysis","text":"documentation SplineOmics package functions can viewed ","code":""},{"path":"https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics/articles/RNA-seq-analysis.html","id":"load-the-packages","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Load the packages","title":"RNA-seq-analysis","text":"","code":"library(SplineOmics) library(readr) # For reading the meta CSV file library(here) # For managing filepaths #> here() starts at /home/thomas/Documents/PhD/projects/DGTX/SplineOmics_hub/SplineOmics library(dplyr) # For data manipulation #>  #> Attaching package: 'dplyr' #> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats': #>  #>     filter, lag #> The following objects are masked from 'package:base': #>  #>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union library(knitr) # For Showing the head of the data and the meta tables."},{"path":"https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics/articles/RNA-seq-analysis.html","id":"load-the-files","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Load the files","title":"RNA-seq-analysis","text":"","code":"data <- readRDS(xzfile(system.file(     \"extdata\",     \"rna_seq_data.rds.xz\",     package = \"SplineOmics\" )))  meta <- readr::read_csv(     system.file(         \"extdata\",         \"rna_seq_meta.csv\",         package = \"SplineOmics\"     ),     show_col_types = FALSE )"},{"path":"https://csbg.github.io/SplineOmics/articles/RNA-seq-analysis.html","id":"show-top-rows-of-data","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Load the files","what":"Show top rows of data","title":"RNA-seq-analysis","text":"data: numeric matrix row represents gene (features) column corresponds sample. row names matrix contain gene identifiers, columns aligned sample metadata meta. matrix contains expression values 136 samples.
